# LpGBT

The lpGBT ASIC (Low Power GigaBit Transceiver) is a new 65nm-CMOS radiation tolerant serializer/deserializer device that can be used on the front-end electronics of the HL-LHC detectors. This component is foreseen to be used by CMS and ATLAS for their system upgrades and offers a set of encoding and decoding schemes specifically tailored to meet their needs in terms of radiation-hardness and data bandwidth.
The lpGBT-FPGA project started in 2018 as a natural evolution of the existing GBT-FPGA to provide a back-end counterpart to the future lpGBT ASIC. The new FPGA IP implements the encoding/decoding schemes supported by the front-end ASIC, meaning that it can be configured using 4 different combinations for the upstream link (from Front-end to Back-end): two decoding schemes (FEC5 or FEC12) based on Reed-Solomon techniques to configure the encoding robustness and two line rates (10.24 or 5.12Gbps) depending on the required bandwidth. Additionally, the lpGBT-FPGA core features an asymmetric architecture to match the lpGBT ASIC specificities: the transmitter part of the IP, as opposed to the configurable receiver part, proposes a single encoding scheme (FEC12) and a lower line rate of 2.56Gbps. Such an asymmetry prevents the IP to be used in loopback mode for self-testing.
